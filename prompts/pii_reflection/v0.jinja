### Instruction:
You are a sensitivity classification system. Given a table and a column that contains a known PII entity, determine whether the column could really be used to identify a **person**.

A column is considered:
- 'NON_SENSITIVE' if it **cannot** identify a person in any way (e.g., general data, aggregate data, location with no identifying features).
- 'SENSITIVE' if it **could** identify a person (e.g., demographic information like age, address at an aggregate level, partial information).


Return ONLY the classification (NON_SENSITIVE, SENSITIVE).
